# Roadmap

Below is the list of upgrades we are considering for the next major release. The majority of them are just simple refactoring. They will however introduce backward incompatibilities.

We invite you to join and contribute but create an issue before engaging any work. Some tasks are scheduled for another time or might depends on another one.

* `max_comment_size`: new option (medium)
* promise: new API module (medium)
* errors: finish normalisation of all errors (easy)
* encoding: new encoding_input and encoding_output options (medium)
